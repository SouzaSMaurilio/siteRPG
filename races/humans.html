                <b>History of Humans:</b> This is the most common race in the kingdom, its members are spread across
                almost every country.<br>
                The first citation about humans was before the creation of the kingdom, they say that they already
                inhabited tribes in forests,
                riverbanks, mountains, amidst glaciers and deserts. Thus proving to be an extremely resistant and
                adaptable breed. <br>
                Over time, humans gained a reputation for being hospitable and unreliable, a reputation that continues
                to this day.<br><br><br><br>

                    <b>Characteristics:</b> The stature of humans varies greatly from one geographic location to
                    another, even their physical characteristics,
                    in deserts for example humans have darker skin and are taller and more slender, while in the icy
                    plains they have fair skin, are shorter, and have slanted corners of their eyes.<br>
                    Humans are also not known for their strength, endurance, speed, or anything that stands out
                    physically.<br>
                    But they say they are great military strategists and very useful in wars.

            Habits
        </h2>
        <p id="habits">
            As well as their physical characteristics, the customs of humans vary from place to place, humans in the
            central region of the kingdom are polytheistic, and worship several gods related to the sky,
            such as the moon, clouds, sun, stars and each with its own name.<br>
            Already in the frozen lands, there is only one god, who they call the creator, but there are several
            children of that one who are distributed throughout the world, giving humans the grace of their father.<br>
            In terms of parties and events, it is rare for two tribes or cities of humans to celebrate the same dates,
            for the same issues, in large cities it is common to see parties for the creator of the city, or for its
            kings, princes and heroes, while in villages and tribes it is common to celebrate the day of fertility, day
            of the sun, eclipses and the like.
